# Soliloquy Specs

This project is a series of interfaces whose namespace (beneath "soliloquy") specify an intended module.

This project is to only contain interfaces. Any implementations are to be placed in separate projects for the corresponding modules.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the Soliloquy Specs running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

### Installing

This project is simply a collection of interfaces; no special installation steps are required.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.

## Contributing

A section on contributing to this project will be added at a later date (when a full release version is finalized).

## Authors

All authors are welcome. Authors will be identified by contributions to the repository. Authors are welcome to identify themselves in the documentation of classes to which they have substantially contributed. At present, no formal or typical procedure exists by which contributions are verified or permitted.

## License

A license for open and free use is under consideration; at present, it has not been finalized, and therefore this code remains private property. This will be hashed out prior to the release of the first full version.
